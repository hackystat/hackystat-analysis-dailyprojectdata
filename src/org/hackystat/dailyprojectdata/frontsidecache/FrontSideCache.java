/**
 * A cache for successfully DPD instances.  It is a "front side" cache, in the sense
 * that it faces the clients, as opposed to the caches associated with the SensorDataClient
 * instances, which are "back side" in that they cache sensor data instances.  While the
 * "back side" caches avoid calls to the lower-level sensorbase, this front-side cache 
 * avoids the overhead of DPD computation itself.
 * <p>
 * The front side cache is organized as follows.  Each DPD instance is associated with a 
 * project and a project owner. The FrontSideCache is implemented as a collection of
 * UriCaches, one for each project owner.  When a client adds data to the FrontSideCache, it
 * must supply the project owner (which is used to figure out which UriCache to use),
 * the URI of the DPD request (which is the key), and the string representation of the 
 * DPD (which is the value).  
 * <p>
 * The FrontSideCache currently has hard-coded maxLife of 1000 hours and each UriCache has
 * a capacity of 1M instances. We could set these via ServerProperties values if necessary. 
 * <p>
 * There is one important component missing from the FrontSideCache, and that is access
 * control.  The FrontSideCache does not check to see if the client checking the cache has 
 * the right to retrieve the cached data.  To perform access control, you should use 
 * the SensorDataClient.inProject(owner, project) method, which checks to see if the 
 * user associated with the SensorDataClient instance has the right to access information
 * about the project identified by the passed owner/project pair.  To see how this 
 * works, here is some example get code, which checks the cache but only returns the 
 * DPD instance if the calling user is in the project:
 * <pre>
 * String cachedDpd = this.server.getFrontSideCache().get(uriUser, uriString);
 * if (cachedDpd != null && client.inProject(authUser, project)) {
 *   return super.getStringRepresentation(cachedDpd);
 * }
 * </pre>
