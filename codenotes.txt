OK, I'm worrying about the following things:

- The server package classes seem highly redundent with the SensorBase versions.  Not sure how,
whether, or why to refactor them.

- The authentication resource approach seems like it could be reused without changes in other services.
Again, how to package this appropriately.

- Authentication itself seems problematic.  This is all 'project' stuff, which means that I need the 
project-level access control implementation.  I also seem to need to know if my user is the admin,
if I want the admin to be able to access anyone's DPD stuff (which seems like a good idea). 

- Once I authenticate, then I need to figure out the processing and the caching. There's two kinds of 
caching to think about:

* Caching the responses from the SensorBase. 
* Caching the results of the DPD abstraction so that I don't need to recompute?
